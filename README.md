# Shapley-Clusters
Simple Data Visulization and Exploratory Data Analysis of the Shapley Galaxy dataset.


The dataset has the following columns:

- R.A. = Right ascension: Coordinate in the sky similar to longitude on Earth, 0 to 360 degrees
- Dec. = Declination: Coordinate in the sky similar to latitude on Earth, -90 to +90 degrees  
- Mag = Magnitude: An inverted logarithmic measure of galaxy brightness in the optical band.  A Mag=17 galaxy is 100-times fainter than a Mag=12 galaxy.  Value is         missing for some galaxies.
- V = Velocity: Speed of the galaxy moving away from Earth, after various corrections are applied
- SigV = Sigma of velocity: Heteroscedastic measurement error known for each individual velocity mesurement




Using Astronomical Coordinate System the galaxies are plotted against Right ascension and Declination, which in result shows their position in the sky.
